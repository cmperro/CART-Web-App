Whenever you pull, be sure to:
	chmod 777 accounts.txt
	chmod 777 uploaded_spreadsheets
	chmod 777 saved_pngs

Note:
	The directories "saved_pngs" and "uploaded_spreadsheets" are not
	included in the repository, due to the fact that they may/probably
	will be empty for most of the time and github doesn't like empty
	directories. However, be sure to keep them in your own copy
	because they are needed for the program to function properly.
